Description: This code is an expanding of  [surfinBH](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH).
        
        # SurfinBH
        
        _**surfinBH**_ provides _**sur**rogate **fin**al **B**lack_ _**H**ole_
        properties for mergers of binary black holes (BBH).
        
        If you find this package useful in your work, Please also cite [surfinBH](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH) and relativate papers in the ReadMe file of [surfinBH](https://github.com/vijayvarma392/surfinBH).
        
        This package is compatible with both python2 and python3.
        
        # This code
        
        We expand surfinBH so that it can estimate the memory an BBH event leaves in spacetime. 
        
        This fit is described in the following paper:
        [1] Zhi-Chao Zhao, Xiaolin Liu, Zhoujian Cao, et al., [arxiv:ToBePublished].
        
        Note: the result of this code is ```log10(memory)``` and the GPR error of ```log10(memory)```
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        ### From source
        
        ```shell
        git clone https://github.com/Zhi-ChaoZhao/NRSurMemory_7qd4
        cd surfinBH
        git submodule init
        git submodule update
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        If you do not have root permissions, replace the last step with
        `python setup.py install --user`
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        All of these can be installed through pip or conda.
        * [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
        * [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/install.html)
        * [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/build.html)
        * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) (at least 0.19.1)

        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        import surfinBH
        ```
        
        
        ```python
        fit_name = 'NRSurMemory_7dq4Remnant'
        
        surfinBH.fits_collection[fit_name].desc
        >>> 'Fits for the gravitational wave memory for generically precessing BBH systems up to mass ratio 4.'
        
        surfinBH.fits_collection[fit_name].refs
        >>> 'arxiv:ToBePublished'
        ```
        
        ### Load the fit
        This only needs to be done **once** at the start of your script.
        If the fit data is not already downloaded, this will also download the data.
        
        ```python
        fit = surfinBH.LoadFits(fit_name)
        >>> Loaded NRSurMemory_7dq4Remnant fit.
        ```
        ### Evaluation
        The evaluation of each fit is different, so be sure to read the documentation.
        This also describes the frames in which different quantities are defined.
        
        ```python
        help(fit)
        ```
        
        We also provide ipython example for usage of this fit:
